## Environment Variables

The project relies on environment variables stored in a .env. file located at the root of the directory to manage configurations. Ensure that essential variables such as database connection strings, API keys, or any other sensitive information are properly set up.

```bash
DATABASE_URL: "*YOUR-DB-URL*"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APIKEY: "*YOUR-NEXT-PUBLIC-KEY*".
```

Be sure to replace `*YOUR-DB-URL*` with your actual MySQL database url containing data and `*YOUR-NEXT-PUBLIC-KEY*` with your Next.js public API key. These values should be obtained from the respective services and kept confidential.

**Note**: Environment variables containing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or any other secrets should not be committed to version control. Ensure that the `.env` files are included in your project's `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.
